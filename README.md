## The standard received a significant update as ECMAScript edition 3 in 1999

## Several months later, Microsoft released JScript with Internet Explorer 3

## ECMAScript edition 5, published in December of 2009

## 6th major edition of the standard, published in June of 2015.

## Note: Because it is more familiar, we will refer to ECMAScript as "JavaScript" from this point on.

## Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages â€” many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well.

# variable

- let allows you to declare block-level variables. The declared variable is available from the block it is enclosed in.

* const allows you to declare variables whose values are never intended to change. The variable is available from the block it is declared in.
* starting with ECMAScript 2015, let and const declarations allow you to create block-scoped variables

# falsy truthy

# Ternary operator

## JavaScript objects can be thought of as simple collections of name-value pairs. As such, they are similar to:

- Dictionaries in Python.
- Hashes in Perl and Ruby.
- Hash tables in C and C++.
- HashMaps in Java.
- Associative arrays in PHP.

## Arrays in JavaScript are actually a special type of object
